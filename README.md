The RecyclerView is the replacement for the deprecated ListView. You can use it in your app to display a large list of data in a memory efficient way.
In this playlist you will learn how to create a RecyclerView, together with the necessary RecyclerView.Adapter, it's corresponding ViewHolder and layout files, the LayoutManager and a Java model class. You will learn how to connect everything together, how to populate the RecyclerView with data, how to insert, update and delete entries with animations and how to handle click events on the single items in the RecyclerView and send them back to the activity over an interface.
